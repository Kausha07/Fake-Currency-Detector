# Counterfeit Indian Currency Detection System

Detects Counterfeit Indian Currency using Image Processing Techniques

## Overview
This project is designed to authenticate Indian currency notes by analyzing input images and determining whether the note is genuine or counterfeit. It leverages advanced image processing and computer vision techniques along with an interactive GUIâ€”all implemented using Python in Jupyter Notebooks.

## Features
- **Automated Detection:** Determines if a currency note is real or counterfeit.
- **Image Processing:** Utilizes OpenCV for feature extraction and analysis.
- **Interactive GUI:** Provides an intuitive interface for users through Tkinter.
- **Detailed Analysis:** Displays input images alongside similarity scores and feature evaluations.

## Libraries and Tools
- **OpenCV:** For robust image processing operations.
- **Tkinter:** To build interactive graphical user interfaces.
- **NumPy:** For numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib:** For data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** To run and interact with the code.

## Dataset
This system currently supports Indian currency notes of 500 and 2000 rupees. The dataset, which is included in this repository, consists of:
- Authentic currency notes (in the `Dataset` directory).
- Counterfeit currency notes (in the `Fake Notes` directory).

Detailed information about the dataset and its structure is available in the project report included in this repository.
